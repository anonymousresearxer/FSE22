## FSE'22 Models, Categorical Operations and Datasets

This data-set contains:
1. The 3 categorical QVMs in CQL alongside the 6 formalised operations.
2. The 3 categorical QVMs in Clafer.
3. The 3 categorical QVMs in AAFM Python Framework.
4. A Microsoft Excel file with the scalability results obtained.
5. A file with EDGE SPL time (seconds) and energy (watts) QAs measurements.


## Automated Reasoners
- CQL IDE: https://github.com/CategoricalData/CQL
- Clafer Tools: https://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions.html
- AAFM Python Frameowrk: https://pypi.org/project/famapy/


## Requirements

The data-set has been generated using Java JDK 17.0.2 for CQL IDE and Clafer, Python 3.9.8 x86_64 for AAFM Python Framework, and MariaDB 10.7.3 x86_64 for HADAS.
